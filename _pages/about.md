<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the School of Transportation Engineering at Chang'an University, where I am a member of Prof. Wang Jianjun's research group. I earned my undergraduate degree in Transportation Engineering from the School of Civil Engineering at Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology. Subsequently, I completed my master‚Äôs degree in Transportation and Logistics Engineering at Chang'an University, where I was accepted into the integrated master's and Ph.D. program during my second year.

My research interests lie in transportation planning and management, with a particular focus on traffic safety, environmental impact assessment of traffic systems, and the emerging field of intelligent transportation. I am eager to engage in discussions and collaborations with fellow scholars and students.
